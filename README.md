# Dog-Breed-Classification using images

## Overview

This notebook builds and end to end image calssifier using TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub. 

## Steps

1. **Problem Definition:**
   - Identifying the breed of dog given an image of the dog

2. **Data:**
   - The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's "Dog Breed Identification" competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification). It includes over 10000+ images.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - The Evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of test image (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation)
4. **Features:**
   - There are 120 dog breeds in the data we need to classify from one of them.
   - We have about 10,000+ images in training set.
   - We have about 10,000+ images in test set.

## Usage

1. **Notebook Link:**
   - View the notebook using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/AnkitNub/dog-breed-classification/blob/main/Dog_breed_identification.ipynb).

2. **Execution:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebook locally:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Bluebook-for-bulldozers.ipynb
     ```

   - Run through each cell to get optimal results.

3. **Outcome:**
   - Analyze the results, model performance, and insights derived from the regression analysis.
